# DSD Research Project
A small data analysis project I did using Python and Google Colab.

The project was centered around analyzing factors that affect college graduation rate. The results were inconclusive but did suggest a need for further investigation.

You can read the report for the project [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10pQhnDqQicTvGSuASQQwKU8c0aGet4r5t6yln1GfppI/edit?usp=sharing)

This project was done for the Data Science Discovery course in the Digital Scholars program (2023).
